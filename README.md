# NYCTaxi-Spark
Some simple Spark SQL code to query and manipulate a collection of the NYCTaxi dataset available at http://nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml

Can be run with Spark by calling sbt package, and then using spark-submit, after moving the January 2017 folder into src/data, and updating the Directory path in scala file.
